## Project Overview

Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining traction in India as the country moves towards sustainable transportation. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict sales trends and patterns of electric vehicles across various states in India. The goal is to provide stakeholders with insights that can help in decision-making processes related to production, marketing, and policy-making.

The project features a user-friendly web interface built with Flask, allowing users to interact with the data and visualizations seamlessly. 

## Features

- **Sales Prediction**: Predicts future sales of electric vehicles using historical data.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Users can visualize data trends through charts and graphs.
- **State-wise Analysis**: Provides insights into sales performance across different Indian states.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes random forest and other algorithms for accurate predictions.
- **Modern UI**: A clean and intuitive interface for an enhanced user experience.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages various technologies and libraries:

- **Python**: The main programming language for the backend.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the web application.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the frontend development.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For prototyping and testing the machine learning models.
